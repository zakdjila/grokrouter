# Unreleased — Claude Agent SDK provider

Adds `claude` as a third provider alongside Codex SDK and OpenRouter. Unlike OpenRouter, which reaches Claude as a plain chat completion, this runs the Claude Code harness inside the Bot computer: Claude gets its own Bash, file editing and web tools in the working directory, while outer Grok tools still come back through the structured `toolCalls` bridge.

- `/provider claude`, `/models`, `/model opus|sonnet|haiku|fable`, `/reasoning` and `/router doctor` all understand the new provider.
- Credentials are a subscription token from `claude setup-token` or an Anthropic API key, stored in Grok Bot's Secrets store. `--claude-host-login` instead relies on a `claude login` run inside the Bot computer.
- Each Bot keeps its own Claude session id in the existing thread state, so switching provider or model still starts a clean thread.
- **Not covered by the beta.47 live gates.** No install into a real Bot computer has been performed. See [TEST-MATRIX](docs/TEST-MATRIX.md) for exactly what was and was not verified.
- Upgrading an already installed beta.47 router needs a stock restore and a fresh install: the generated host adapter changed, so previous-adapter reconstruction will not match it.

# GrokRouter 0.1.0-beta.47 — source prerelease

- Restores exact reviewed host hash and byte-count verification. Structural diagnostics cannot authenticate a stock host.
- Rejects an unknown or foreign live host even when a trusted old backup exists. Automatic repair cannot silently replace a newer incompatible host.
- Reconstructs supported published adapters from trusted originals before upgrading. Doctor now detects tampered adapter contents, not just marker presence.
- Scopes channel-control receipts to the originating host request and keeps fresh commands ahead of follow-on suppression. Unrelated conversations remain independent.
- Keeps an unrelated explicit user query from being replaced by a retained workflow definition.
- Adds separately gated official Grok Bot 0.36.0 compatibility, version-specific signed registries, and macOS vendor-signature verification.
- Parses expanded native skill-menu invocations and preserves per-Bot settings, saved threads, receipts, and audit history during runtime replacement.
- Makes the native Reasoning entry show the current effort when invoked without an argument.
- Repairs brokered delivery detection, failed-delivery recovery, parent/child completion, Codex empty-response recovery, and management Doctor exit status.
- Returns one normal tool-free new-Bot greeting, keeps standalone literal replies tool-free, and normalizes verified printed delivery envelopes only when they contain the exact requested text.
- Acknowledges a verified background launch once and waits for its actual finished-child result before delivering the answer.
- Isolates native memory extraction and periodic episode summaries from chat tools, saved threads, and delivery receipts. Explicit native maintenance sessions retain Grok's original backend.
- Gives native command registration time to load its workflow library while keeping ordinary diagnostic requests bounded.
- Builds Windows packages with the Electron version pinned in their manifest.
- Makes source tagging depend on CI and a versioned acceptance record tied to the candidate's source digest. Keeps the existing download link until the new tag is available.
- Adds CodeQL analysis, release validation tests, and clearer compatibility/recovery documentation.

The unchanged final Mac artifact passed all seven required live gates independently on official Grok Bot 0.30.0 and 0.36.0. Codex Sol and OpenRouter Claude completed real computer tools and returned actual native child results once. Published September 9, 2026, after the protected release workflow passed. [Download tagged source](https://github.com/promptadvisers/grokrouter/releases/tag/source-v0.1.0-beta.47). Windows remains a source preview; 0.44.0 and unreviewed host hashes remain unsupported. Provider/helper limitations and exact receipts are recorded in [the verification matrix](docs/TEST-MATRIX.md).

# GrokRouter 0.1.0-beta.46

Historical notes below describe beta.46's released policy. The maintenance review did not authenticate every reported host as stock; structural checks did not establish that provenance. Beta.47 restores exact reviewed verification and fixes the unsafe backup fallback.

Installs on rotating Grok Bot 0.30.0 host builds without a per-hash approval.

- Public issues #1 through #5 all failed the same way: a genuine stock Bot-computer host whose SHA-256 was not yet on the signed list. At least seven distinct 0.30.0 host hashes were reported in one day, so an exact allowlist cannot keep up.
- The host adapter now has a second acceptance tier, **structural verification**: the host carries no GrokRouter, legacy, or other-router marker; every required source anchor appears exactly once; a read-only patch passes `node --check`; and the byte count is within the manifest's band (20–40 MB). The exact signed list still runs first. Both tiers back up the untouched host before patching, and the backup now follows the live stock variant so Restore returns exactly what was running.
- Doctor, install, and the safe diagnostic report state the trust tier (`HOSTTRUST=EXACT-ALLOWLIST`, `ANCHOR-VERIFIED`, or `NONE`) and, when a host is rejected, the plain reason. Structural verdicts are cached beside the file so the lifecycle watchdog does not re-run the read-only patch every five seconds.
- The policy lives in `patch/manifests/0.30.0.json` under `anchorVerifiedHosts`; setting `enabled` to `false` restores the strict exact-hash behavior. The development override, restore, repair, and watchdog paths all honor the same rules.
- The Mac and Windows installers read the Bot terminal through screenshot OCR. Attempt IDs now use only OCR-safe characters (no 0/O, 1/I, 5/S, 8/B, 7/T, 2/Z, 6/G), the failure marker matches on its stable prefix, and common digit/letter confusions are folded before comparison. Real beta.44 reports showed hex IDs like `7E0DBDB8` coming back as `TEODBDB8`, which hid the actual failed phase behind a generic "terminal stopped" message.
- The completion timeout is now measured from the last observed phase instead of the start, so a slow first-time Codex dependency download no longer times out while it is still making progress.
- The adapter-phase failure text tells users who previously installed OpenGrok or another router to run Restore Stock Grok Bot first.
- The failure marker in the typed install command is now base64-encoded like the success marker. Public issue #7 showed the OCR loop reading `INSTALL_FAILED` from the still-visible command line and reporting "The Bot computer stopped before installation completed" while install.sh was still running and later succeeded.

# GrokRouter 0.1.0-beta.45

Signed compatibility updates for Grok Bot 0.30.0's rotating Bot-computer hosts.

- GrokRouter still requires an exact stock-host SHA-256, exact byte count, and every bundled source anchor exactly once. Unknown hosts remain untouched.
- If the bundled list does not recognize a host, Install Router and Repair Router perform one bounded download of the public host registry and verify its Ed25519 signature with a public key pinned inside the installer.
- A newly reviewed exact host entry can therefore reach existing beta.45 users through **Try installation again** or **Repair Router** without asking everyone to rebuild the Mac app.
- The lifecycle watchdog verifies the cached signed registry and checks for an update no more than once per hour when a replacement host is unknown.
- Unknown variants now report `HOSTSHA1`, `HOSTSHA2`, `HOSTBYTES`, `CLOUDARCH`, `ANCHORS`, and `PATCHDRYRUN` on short OCR-safe lines. The report contains no host source, credentials, conversations, or Bot files.
- The read-only compatibility probe applies the original transformation only to a temporary file, runs `node --check`, deletes the temporary file, and never activates an unknown host.
- The issue form now separates the physical Mac from the Bot computer's cloud architecture, asks for the installer version instead of Grok Bot 0.30.0, and lets users say installation never finished instead of guessing that `/provider` or Doctor passed.

Public issues #1 through #4 all report the same fail-closed cause: additional stock host variants are being served behind Grok Bot 0.30.0. Their exact hashes are not added by assertion alone; each remains pending until its complete fingerprint, read-only dry run, reviewed entry, and live acceptance are recorded.

The exact beta.45 Mac lifecycle completed install → verified stock restore → reinstall. The first live pass caught a one-byte error in the historical stock-host manifest instead of bypassing it; the corrected exact byte count was re-signed, refreshed through the public registry path, and pinned by a regression test. Two genuinely new Bots then passed Doctor, native slash discovery, model switching, provider status, exact-once normal inference, deterministic near-miss controls, and per-Bot default isolation. The temporary diagnostic port was closed before Grok Bot relaunched normally.

# GrokRouter 0.1.0-beta.44

Beginner-safe installer recovery for Grok Bot 0.30.0.

- Every installation now carries a unique attempt ID and reports structured, numbered phases from the Bot computer back to GrokRouter.
- A confirmed terminal failure stops within two checks instead of repeating a generic error until the six-minute completion timeout.
- Dependency, payload, activation, adapter, and verification failures now explain the failed phase in plain English.
- The installer exposes **Try installation again** and **Copy safe diagnostics** after a failure. Diagnostic reports include only platform, version, phase, and sanitized error lines; credentials, conversations, and Bot files are excluded.
- Waiting for a Bot computer now becomes an explicit **Action needed** state after ten seconds.
- Remote terminal state is cleared before each operation so an earlier error cannot poison a later retry.
- Pinned npm downloads use bounded retries and timeouts so temporary registry failures can recover without hanging indefinitely.
- Reinstall retries reuse an already verified same-platform Codex runtime, while OpenRouter-only setup skips the Codex dependency download entirely.
- Mac diagnostic calls close a non-responsive socket after 12 seconds. Transfer retries open a fresh DevTools client, so a replaced Bot-computer webview cannot leave the installer spinning forever.
- Ordinary user turns are claimed atomically before provider inference. Concurrent host replays now produce one provider request and one visible answer; failed provider attempts release the claim so a real retry can proceed.
- Cold stock restore waits up to 45 seconds for Grok Bot's shared workflow library before removing the six router commands.
- Visible Prompt Advisers branding was removed from package metadata, skill metadata, provider headers, and installer publisher identity. The GitHub organization name remains only where the canonical repository URL is required.
- Mac and Windows installer contracts cover the same structured failure and recovery behavior. Windows remains a source preview until native live acceptance passes.
- Windows packaging pins Electron 41.10.3, clearing the high-severity sandbox-navigation advisory reported against the earlier build dependency.

The exact macOS beta.44 lifecycle completed install → verified stock restore → reinstall. A final corrected-runtime reinstall recovered from a real Bot-computer target swap, registered all six commands, closed the diagnostic port, and passed fresh-Bot default isolation, model switching, deterministic near-miss controls, and exact-once normal replies.

Existing installations must rebuild GrokRouter from current source and click **Install Router**. If Codex is enabled, complete **Codex sign-in** afterward.

## GrokRouter 0.1.0-beta.43 hotfix

Provider-switch argument preservation for Grok Bot 0.30.0.

- Fixed `/provider codex` and `/provider openrouter` being reduced to bare `/provider` when Grok retained an older native workflow envelope in the transcript.
- The current exact host transcript and latest visible slash command now outrank retained workflow metadata.
- Grok's slash-chip form, which can expose `provider codex` without the leading slash, is accepted only when the matching registered GrokRouter workflow marker is present.
- Natural-language prose containing a provider command remains ordinary model input and does not gain control authority.
- Added regression coverage for the literal command, the slash-chip form, stale workflow precedence, and the prose safety boundary.

Existing installations must rebuild GrokRouter from current source and click **Install Router** to replace the runtime. If Codex is enabled, complete **Start Codex Sign-in** afterward.

## GrokRouter 0.1.0-beta.40 candidate

Group routing, native control discovery, provider-aware delegation, and a Windows source preview for Grok Bot 0.30.0.

- Router state now follows the stable Bot identity across direct chats and channels. Other channel members and changing conversation IDs cannot silently fork or overwrite that Bot's provider/model choice; earlier combined-ID state migrates on first use.
- A pure leading Bot mention such as `@Research Bot /provider` is handled deterministically for the addressed Bot. Natural-language prose that merely mentions a command still reaches normal inference.
- User-invocable skills publish `/provider`, `/models`, `/model`, `/reasoning`, `/router`, and `/doctor` through Grok's native slash discovery. Existing user skills win name conflicts, Doctor reports them, and uninstall removes only GrokRouter-owned links.
- `/doctor` is a first-class alias for `/router doctor` and never reaches model inference.
- Explicit OpenRouter delegation requests force a supplied orchestration tool or `GetDynamicTools`. When Grok supplies no actionable schemas, the router states that boundary instead of pretending a child started.
- Restored the native Windows x64/Arm64 installer source, exact signed-app/version gate, sandboxed renderer, loopback/noVNC transport, restore path, cross-architecture packaging, checksum generation, and Windows CI. Both ZIP and Inno Setup architectures build on the native runner; Windows launch/install and live Grok Bot acceptance remain pending, so this is a source preview rather than a public compatibility claim.
- Automated coverage now spans group identity/isolation, addressed controls, slash-skill ownership, real-versus-invented delegation, Mac contracts, and Windows source/package contracts.

## GrokRouter 0.1.0-beta.39

Host-replacement recovery for Grok Bot 0.30.0.

Audience delivery:

- Made the complete source repository public with a Mac-first quick start near the top of the README.
- Added a one-command source installer plus a double-click `Install GrokRouter.command` fallback.
- The source installer builds the native Swift app locally, verifies it, installs it to the user's Applications folder without `sudo`, and opens it.
- Removed distributed DMG and Windows release paths. GrokRouter currently supports Apple silicon Macs only.

- Added a persistent, rate-limited watchdog that detects when Grok replaces the live patched host with an allowlisted stock host, reapplies the existing exact hash-and-anchor-gated patch, and restarts the host.
- Added XDG desktop autostart for the watchdog. Intentional stock restore disables and removes it so Restore Stock remains authoritative.
- Added `grokbot-router repair` and a separate **Repair Router** installer action. Unknown hashes and missing anchors still fail closed.
- Doctor now completes its credential sections and emits an explicit completion sentinel even when the host check fails, instead of stopping at the first nonzero patch status.
- Installer OCR screenshots now use bounded JPEG capture, preventing a newly provisioned high-resolution noVNC target from failing with `Message too long`.
- The redesigned macOS app and release archive are now named **GrokRouter**.
- The exact beta.39 artifact reinstalled on the replacement host, then passed a genuinely-new-Bot beta.39 doctor and deterministic OpenRouter Claude `/provider` receipt. The installer Doctor also completed across a target rotation without the former message-size failure, and the separate one-click Repair action completed before `/provider` passed again after its restart.

Beta.38 previously added fresh-Bot usability and delivery-loop hardening:

- Added a plain-English end-to-end guide plus an editable 16:9 SVG and 4K PNG for explaining the router on YouTube
- Added a repository-level coding-agent guide and exact fresh-Bot acceptance gate so a new agent cannot mistake an old Bot or mocked response for completion
- Documented that composer controls are deterministic but do not appear in Grok Bot's native slash menu, and that current OpenRouter computer/sub-agent parity remains unverified
- Long noVNC text transfers are now paced in eight-character batches; the installer no longer treats a queued RFB burst as proof that the guest terminal received the entire base64 line
- Every transfer attempt now sends Ctrl-C through the verified RFB session before typing, so an interrupted install cannot leave a partial shell line that corrupts restore or reinstall
- The verified stock backup now lives under persistent `/home/box/sand-data/grokbot-router-backup/` instead of the replaceable live-host directory; the old backup path remains a migration source
- The compatibility manifest accepts a second exact Grok Bot 0.30.0 stock-host SHA only after a read-only dry run verified every required patch anchor exactly once
- Computer discovery now reuses an existing noVNC target before clicking `Open computer`, preventing the installer from rotating a valid session between transport and payload phases
- Terminal safety checks now use accurate Vision OCR so a small computer preview is recognized before the dock fallback can toggle an already-open Terminal away
- Stock restore now prints its authoritative success sentinel before a delayed host restart, preventing a correct restore from being reported as a VNC-reconnect failure

- Remote desktop points are now interpolated into JavaScript, mapped through the live noVNC canvas bounds and 1280×800 intrinsic framebuffer dimensions, and serialized across the Swift/JavaScript bridge before clicking, so the 700×768 Terminal point lands correctly in both preview and fullscreen
- The native installer now verifies that a real terminal prompt is visible before typing; if Ctrl–Alt–T misses, it clicks Grok Bot 0.30.0's fixed terminal dock icon, refocuses the noVNC keyboard, and retries automatically
- The dock fallback now allows 12 seconds for Xfce Terminal to cold-start, while continuing to require visible `Terminal` and workspace prompt evidence before any payload text is sent
- The Ctrl–Alt–T path now gets the same verified 12-second cold-start window before the dock fallback is attempted, preventing a late-opening terminal from being immediately toggled back to the desktop
- Remote pointer and special-key input now call the connected RFB instance exported by Grok Bot's pinned noVNC UI, bypassing Electron nested-input calls and synthetic browser events that could report success without a guest-side effect
- Remote command text now also travels character-by-character through `UI.rfb.sendKey`; the installer no longer uses Electron `Input.insertText`, which could place the transport command into Grok chat instead of the Bot terminal
- Terminal-opening failures remain fail-closed before payload transfer, with a specific diagnostic instead of sending install text into the chat composer
- The first harmless terminal transport probe now uses the same fresh-webview retry loop as payload transfer, so a manual `Open computer` click can rotate Grok's DevTools session without forcing the user to restart the installer
- An explicit initial `use ... tool` request now sends OpenRouter `tool_choice: required`; resumed tool-result rounds return to `auto` so the model can deliver the final answer instead of repeating the call
- When that request explicitly names a tool Grok already offered, the first OpenRouter round now forces that exact function by name instead of allowing a discovery or delivery tool to satisfy generic `required`
- A printed direct dynamic tool can be brokered without a discovery block only when the visible user request explicitly named that exact tool; a different or unmentioned tool stays inert
- OpenRouter responses that print `to=functions...` markup instead of returning a native function call are recovered into one real Grok call only when that exact tool was offered by the host
- Textual-call recovery now tolerates the live Luna dialect's Unicode object-replacement characters and fenced JSON while keeping the search bounded to one marker-local object
- A recovered pseudo-call returns no provider-printed markup to Grok; the native host call executes first and only the resumed result round can produce the user-facing answer
- When several printed offered calls appear, an explicitly user-named offered tool outranks later provider-invented delivery syntax
- When a hard-forced, explicitly named offered tool is returned as bare JSON with no function marker, one object is recoverable only if it satisfies that exact offered tool's required schema; delivery-shaped JSON is never treated as tool arguments
- If that hard-forced object contains wire-invalid control characters, required string fields can be decoded individually only when the exact offered schema declares them as strings
- Redacted `turn_ok` audit receipts now include counts for function markers, object starts, native calls, and recovered calls on explicit tool requests, without storing provider text or user content
- The recovery path accepts the second live OpenRouter dialect where `GetDynamicTools` omits `code:` and a discovered tool such as `Shell` is printed as a direct call
- A printed direct dynamic tool is wrapped through Grok's offered `CallDynamicTool` broker only when the same response first discovered that exact tool name; mismatched or undiscovered names remain inert
- Repeated printed discovery attempts collapse to one actionable `CallDynamicTool` request, preventing a model-authored transcript from masquerading as successful computer access
- Tool-enabled OpenRouter turns now state the exact offered tool names and explicitly forbid narrating tool markup as assistant text
- Audit `turn_ok` receipts record `recoveredTextualToolCall: true` when the guarded compatibility path was required
- Automatic new-Bot greetings now receive no outer-tool schemas, preventing a greeting from wandering into dynamic-tool discovery before the user sends a message
- Host-side adapter failures now append a bounded, redacted `host_bridge_error` event to the normal router audit instead of existing only in the remote host console

- `/models <id>` now works as a forgiving alias for `/model <id>`
- A listed OpenRouter `vendor/model` ID can be pasted by itself to switch
- `/models` now prints the exact next-step instruction
- Invalid model commands are handled deterministically instead of leaking into model chat
- Routed models receive authoritative provider/model/control-plane context
- Visible assistant delivery stops repeated inference and duplicate follow-up bubbles
- Delivery completion is recorded only after Grok returns a real delivery receipt; an old greeting or earlier response can no longer suppress a later turn
- Native tool-result wrappers and ordinary hidden continuation prompts are filtered so `Shell` and dynamic-tool calls do not repeat as new user requests
- Tagged Grok background completions now revive the routed parent turn, allowing a finished sub-agent result to replace the earlier launch acknowledgement
- Automated fresh-Bot regression tests cover the exact previously failing input sequence
- Automated revival coverage proves a child completion still runs after the launch response was already delivered, then stops after the child result receipt
- Durable `sandAutomationCompletionId` signatures suppress sequential and concurrent host replays without blocking later tool-result rounds
- A late receipt for the earlier “subagent started” message can no longer suppress the finished child's continuation
- Capitalization, whitespace variants, unsupported router commands, and unlisted bare model IDs are intercepted deterministically instead of reaching inference
- State updates now merge under the per-Bot lock, so a late tool or turn write cannot revert a provider/model switch
- A stable Grok Bot/conversation identifier now outranks turn-scoped request IDs when deriving the state key; model and provider switches therefore survive the next normal message instead of forking into a default-model state file
- Snake-case Bot IDs plus chat, thread, lineage, and root IDs are accepted as stable conversation identity candidates
- Codex now receives the same cleaned background-completion transcript as OpenRouter; ordinary hidden nudges remain private
- Provider errors written to the host result are redacted, bounded, and never include a recognizable API-key token
- Installer operations close their temporary loopback diagnostic port and relaunch Grok Bot normally on both success and failure
- Upgrades replace stale model catalogs from the packaged manifest while preserving existing provider/model selections unless explicit installer flags override them
- Host child processes ignore expected stdin `EPIPE`, escalate timed-out turns to `SIGKILL`, retain only the four newest timestamped host backups, and retain only two previous runtime directories
- Compatibility manifest marker now matches the current V37 patch
- Exact-text OpenRouter turns no longer receive outer-tool schemas, preventing a literal reply from wandering into an unrelated `GetDynamicTools` call
- The management CLI is linked into `/usr/local/bin` when the Bot computer supports passwordless installation, so documented `grokbot-router` commands work in a fresh terminal
- Outstanding outer tool calls now survive assistant status text, reasoning, and Grok permission UI; only the matching result settles the call
- Known camel-case, snake-case, single-object, string-result, orphan, and dangling Grok tool wrappers are normalized into a valid provider transcript
- Every early suppression writes a redacted `turn_suppressed` receipt with a bounded reason and non-secret protocol IDs
- Empty OpenRouter continuations retry once; a completed background child deterministically falls back to its tagged result instead of disappearing
- Completion latches expire, controls bypass them, and reset epochs prevent a late Codex result from resurrecting a cleared thread
- Provider tool-call IDs are replaced with router-owned UUIDs before crossing into Grok's host protocol
- The patched host launches the adapter with an explicit environment allowlist instead of inheriting every host variable
- Added a mandatory fresh-Bot release gate and coding-agent cold-start guide

The beta.2 foundation remains:

- Native Mac installer for Codex SDK and OpenRouter
- Loopback/noVNC install with no Accessibility permission
- Exact-version/hash gate, checksummed payload, verified stock backup, and one-click restore
- Per-Bot provider, model, reasoning, and Codex thread state
- Codex structured bridge to Grok tools
- OpenRouter native function-call and multimodal tool-result bridge
- In-chat provider/model controls and a redacted doctor command
- Automated runtime, patch, rollback, end-to-end payload, and installer build tests
- Codex CLI/SDK pinned to 0.151.0 with verified ChatGPT device authorization
- Reconnect-safe, quote-free chunked payload transfer with real-output-only completion markers
- Success marker is emitted before the delayed host restart, preventing false-negative installs after a VNC reconnect
- Removed a redundant OCR acknowledgement that could be lost during a legitimate noVNC target swap
- Provider selection remains visible after an installer operation completes
- Live Codex parity verified for text, outer Shell/Read, Screenshot, and dynamic sub-agent execution
- OpenRouter key-shape validation in the installer, runtime, and doctor command
- Beta.31's audit exposed the root mismatch behind the original screenshot: the Luna switch and the following prompt used different state files because a stable Bot identifier was combined with a changing request ID. The following prompt therefore ran on default Claude. Beta.32 makes stable Bot identity authoritative.
- The exact beta.32 artifact passed live new-Bot greeting, doctor, catalog, bare Luna switching, provider/model identity on the next normal turn, exact-once text, and second-Bot isolation. This proves the deterministic install/model-switch demo path.
- Full OpenRouter tool parity remains blocked on the current live host: the beta.32 Shell turn received zero actionable native tool schemas, so guarded recovery correctly refused to execute provider-printed pseudo Shell markup. Screenshot and returned-child claims remain outside the film-ready scope until the host supplies those schemas and the full gate passes.
- The exact beta.38 artifact passed install, authoritative verified-stock restore, post-restore reinstall, a genuinely new Bot reporting beta.38, Luna persistence into the following normal inference, one `BETA38_FRESH_TEXT_OK` delivery, and second-Bot default isolation. ZIP SHA-256: `4a0f704c96a532d7000459fbf09090d33897e9cbace5c833bf0c4d67fe117235`.

Known limitations: direct Anthropic SDK support is not included; Claude models are available through OpenRouter. Native slash entries remain subject to Grok skill discovery and name conflicts, while the literal composer controls remain available.
