# Verification matrix

Verification lock: September 9, 2026. GrokRouter `0.1.0-beta.47`, production commit `644a9c4`. All seven required live gates passed independently on official Grok Bot **0.30.0 and 0.36.0** with the same Mac artifact. The protected release workflow passed and the source prerelease was published September 9, 2026. See [publication verification](release-beta47-publication.md).

Source digest: `86e10453fc44d718321226487aa7f7dd5d3572c900cc96d16fe55e857b48af02`.

The dated receipts are in [0.30.0 acceptance](acceptance-beta47-644a9c4-0.30.0.md) and [0.36.0 acceptance](acceptance-beta47-644a9c4-0.36.0.md). The [machine-readable record](release-acceptance.json) binds every gate to the production source and both exact desktop versions.

| Required gate | 0.30.0 | 0.36.0 | Evidence checked |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mac install → stock restore → reinstall | Passed | Passed | Actual terminal success markers, exact restored stock hash, strict adapter and backup Doctor |
| Fresh-Bot controls | Passed | Passed | New Bots after reinstall, normal tool-free greetings, all six native entries, catalog/model/identity, exact text, command edge cases |
| Two-Bot isolation | Passed | Passed | Second new Bot retains installer default after the first Bot's override |
| Addressed channel controls | Passed | Passed | Three exact control receipts, zero ordinary inference in group interval, durable suppression reasons, independent direct chat |
| Codex capabilities | Passed | Passed | Real outer Shell, Read, Screenshot; actual completed native child returned once to the parent |
| OpenRouter capabilities | Passed | Passed | Real outer Shell, Read, Screenshot; explicit discovery-first delegation, actual completed child returned once |
| Clean source installation | Passed | Passed | Fresh candidate archive, isolated Applications directory, successful local build and signature verification |

Provider capability tests used Codex SDK `gpt-5.6-sol` and OpenRouter `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6`. OpenRouter Luna was verified for model selection, identity, and exact text. These results do not establish tool parity for every catalog model.

## Claude Agent SDK provider (added after the September 9, 2026 lock)

The Claude provider is **not covered by the beta.47 live gates above.** It has not been installed into a Grok Bot computer, and no fresh-Bot acceptance run exists for it. Treat it as unverified for live routing until those gates are repeated.

What has been verified, on macOS against the real `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` 0.3.269 and through `runtime/run-provider.mjs` itself, using `claude-haiku-4-5` at `low` effort (the weakest configuration in the catalog):

| Check | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Structured tool-bridge contract | Passed | `outputFormat` json_schema returns `structured_output` as `{text, toolCalls}` |
| Session continuity | Passed | The same `session_id` was resumed across two turns and the model recalled the earlier turn |
| Claude's own native tools | Passed | A real `Write` into the working directory produced the expected file |
| Outer Grok tool bridge | Passed | A `TakeScreenshot` schema the model does not own came back as a `toolCalls` entry, on both a fresh and a resumed session |
| Image input | Passed | A base64 screenshot block was read correctly through the streaming-input prompt |
| In-chat controls | Passed | `/provider claude`, `/models`, `/model sonnet`, `/router doctor`, `/router help` through the real runtime |
| Credential handling | Passed | Token and API key select their own env var; a malformed value is rejected without being echoed; audit output contains no `sk-ant-` |

One live failure is worth recording. With the first prompt wording, Claude answered *"TakeScreenshot is not currently available in this environment"* instead of bridging the call: it looked only at its own tool list. The prompt now states outright that the outer tools are real, that they will never appear in its own tool list, and that it must not declare one unavailable. A regression test pins all three sentences.

Sub-agent and computer parity for Claude, and every result on a real Bot computer, remain unproven.

## Automated checks

The final production revision passed 70 runtime tests, 17 Python patch/executor tests, installer/payload integration checks, 12 Windows contract tests, and five release/compatibility tests. Mac build/signature verification and clean-source installation passed. GitHub CI `34336489366` passed Mac and native Windows packaging; CodeQL `34336489412` passed JavaScript and Python analysis. Documentation revision `aac8b99` also passed all required checks.

Coverage includes exact host trust, foreign/modified-host refusal, previous-adapter reconstruction, independent Doctor failures, atomic per-Bot state, command authority, tool-call IDs, literal envelope decoding, background completion/acknowledgment ordering, and isolated native memory/episode-summary tasks.

## Limits and observed provider behavior

- Windows x64 and Arm64 ZIP/Setup packaging passed CI. Native Windows Grok Bot launch, installation, restoration, and capability acceptance remain unverified; Windows stays a source preview.
- Only exact supported desktop versions and independently reviewed host hash/size pairs are accepted. Grok Bot 0.44.0 was observed during an automatic update and is unsupported.
- One Codex memory-extraction helper on 0.36.0 returned empty after its bounded retry. It was logged explicitly, did not produce a user error bubble or alter command state, and subsequent extraction and episode-summary helpers succeeded. The 0.30.0 fresh run recorded no provider/helper/host bridge errors. This is not a guarantee that providers never fail.
- An explicit named outer tool takes scheduling priority in a mixed OpenRouter request that also describes delegation. The discovery-first capability probe names the sub-agent tool directly. The earlier mixed probe is recorded separately, not counted as forced-discovery evidence.
- Native maintenance sessions such as memory synthesis retain Grok's original inference backend. Marked extraction and episode summaries use isolated text-only calls and do not share routed chat threads, cached tools, or completion receipts.
- A read-only capability result does not authorize unrelated tools or broader actions. Grok owns offered schemas, permissions, and execution.

Earlier failures and superseded implementations remain in [beta.47 development receipts](verification-beta47.md) and the [historical matrix](TEST-MATRIX-HISTORY.md). Historical passes do not substitute for this release's evidence.
