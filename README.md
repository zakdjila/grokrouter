GrokRouter is an experimental, unofficial, reversible model router. Each Bot remembers its own provider and model. Grok Bot continues to own conversations, files, the computer, permissions, and any outer tools it supplies to the routed model. Native maintenance sessions such as memory synthesis keep Grok's original inference backend.

> **Source prerelease: beta.47.** Verified on official Grok Bot 0.30.0 and 0.36.0 with exact reviewed host fingerprints. [Release notes and source](https://github.com/promptadvisers/grokrouter/releases/tag/source-v0.1.0-beta.47) · [Dated verification](docs/TEST-MATRIX.md).

## Compatibility

| Component | Current boundary |
| --- | --- |
| Grok Bot desktop | Exact official **0.30.0 and 0.36.0**, each independently live-verified |
| macOS | Apple silicon, macOS 12+, Apple Command Line Tools |
| Windows x64 / Arm64 | Source preview; CI packaging is separate from native installation verification |
| Codex SDK | Sign in with your existing Codex account in the Bot computer |
| Claude Agent SDK | A subscription token from `claude setup-token`, or `claude login` in the Bot computer |
| OpenRouter | Your OpenRouter API key; provider usage is billed by OpenRouter |
| Computer and sub-agents | Available only when Grok offers the necessary schemas; see the [verification matrix](docs/TEST-MATRIX.md) for provider-specific evidence |

**Already updated Grok Bot?** Beta.47 supports official 0.36.0 through a separate desktop gate and signed host registry. **0.44.0 and other unlisted versions are unsupported.** The desktop version and cloud host are separate checks: a supported app can still receive an unknown host, which the installer leaves untouched. See [compatibility reports](https://github.com/promptadvisers/grokrouter/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Acompatibility).

## Install on a Mac

1. Open the official Grok Bot **0.30.0 or 0.36.0** app from `/Applications`. Select a Bot, open its **Computer**, and leave it visible.
2. Run the beta.47 source installer in your **Mac's Terminal**:

   ```bash
   /usr/bin/curl --fail --silent --show-error --location https://raw.githubusercontent.com/promptadvisers/grokrouter/source-v0.1.0-beta.47/scripts/install-macos.sh --output /tmp/grokrouter-install.sh && /bin/bash /tmp/grokrouter-install.sh
   ```

   This downloads tagged source, builds and signs the app locally, installs it at `~/Applications/GrokRouter.app`, and opens it. It does not need `sudo`. If Apple Command Line Tools are missing, finish Apple's installation and repeat the command.
3. Choose **Codex SDK**, **Claude Agent SDK**, **OpenRouter**, or any combination. Choose the default provider for new Bots. If using OpenRouter, enter its complete key in the installer. If using Claude, paste a token from `claude setup-token` run on your own machine. The installer hands each one to Grok's protected Secrets store and clears the field.
4. Click **Install Router**. Wait for a successful installation receipt. If using Codex, choose **Codex sign-in** and complete the sign-in shown in the Bot terminal. If you would rather not paste a Claude token, run `claude login` in the Bot terminal instead and install with `--claude-host-login`.
5. Create a **brand-new Bot after installation**. Type these commands manually into its normal chat, one at a time:

   ```text
   /router doctor
   /provider
   ```

   In-chat Doctor must identify the installed router and report runtime and credential health. Use the desktop **Check health** action to verify the live host adapter and stock backup. `/provider` must name the provider and model you selected. Send a normal message and verify it produces one answer.

The slash-suggestion menu is a convenience. If an entry is missing, type the complete command manually; a menu entry alone does not prove routing works.

The ZIP alternative is the release's **Source code (zip) → Install GrokRouter.command**. A ZIP from a development branch contains that branch's candidate, so use the tagged source for this prerelease. If macOS asks whether to open the command, Control-click it and choose **Open**. Do not disable Gatekeeper.

## Choose a model in chat

| Command | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `/provider` | Show this Bot's provider and model |
| `/provider codex` | Switch this Bot to Codex SDK |
| `/provider claude` | Switch this Bot to Claude Agent SDK |
| `/provider openrouter` | Switch this Bot to OpenRouter |
| `/models` | List configured models and switching instructions |
| `/model vendor/model` or `/models vendor/model` | Select a model explicitly |
| A listed `vendor/model` ID by itself | Select that model |
| `/reasoning` | Show this Bot's current reasoning effort |
| `/reasoning low`, `/reasoning medium`, `/reasoning high` | Change a supported reasoning setting |
| `/doctor` or `/router doctor` | Check routing health |
| `/router reset` | Reset the Bot's provider thread while retaining its Grok transcript |
| `/router help` | Show exact supported controls |

In a channel, address a Bot directly, for example `@Research Bot /provider`. Each Bot owns its model state. A control receipt suppresses only follow-on work associated with that same host request; it must not suppress an unrelated conversation. Addressed channel controls passed the exact-candidate release gate on both supported versions.

## Recovery

Use the **GrokRouter desktop app** for installation, health checks, repair, and restoration. Do not ask a Grok conversation to install or patch its own host.

| Symptom | Next step |
| --- | --- |
| Unsupported app version | Stop and check the compatibility table. Reinstalling the same router cannot add version support. |
| Unknown host hash or wrong byte count | Copy safe diagnostics. The installer leaves the live host untouched, even if an old backup exists. A maintainer must review an exact host entry. |
| Prior OpenGrok or another router | Do not layer routers. Use that router's documented removal or explicit verified stock restoration before attempting GrokRouter installation. |
| Runtime version looks correct but adapter is stock or unknown | Runtime files and the live adapter are separate. Run desktop **Check health**. Repair succeeds only for a reviewed stock host or an exactly reconstructed supported router upgrade. |
| Modified router with a valid stock backup | Automatic repair refuses it. Use explicit **Restore stock** if you intend to replace the live host, then install again on a supported version. |
| No verified backup | Stop. Do not copy an arbitrary backup or force installation. Include the complete safe fingerprint in a support issue. |
| Dependency download failure | Check the Bot computer's network, then retry from the desktop installer. |
| Grok answers `/provider` conversationally | Interception is not working. Use desktop health checks and safe diagnostics; the model's explanation is not a router receipt. |
| Missing slash-menu entries | Type the command manually. Repair reconciles GrokRouter-owned entries while preserving conflicting user commands. |
| Windows preview failure | Include the exact CI artifact and Windows architecture; do not run the Mac install command. |

**Restore stock** is an explicit operation. It copies an exactly reviewed original back to the live host and disables the repair watchdog. The runtime and recoverable backups remain on the Bot computer. **Repair** is different: it must never replace an unknown host with an older backup just because that backup exists.

For [installation support](https://github.com/promptadvisers/grokrouter/issues/new?template=installation-failure.yml), include your GrokRouter version, Grok Bot version, platform, prior-router history, and **Copy safe diagnostics** output. Keep `HOSTSHA1`, `HOSTSHA2`, `HOSTBYTES`, `ANCHORS`, `PATCHDRYRUN`, and `HOSTTRUST`. Never post an API key, sign-in code, private conversation, or Grok's host source.

## What verification means

GrokRouter requires an exact reviewed **SHA-256 and byte count**, then checks every source anchor and syntax-checks the transformed file. Entries come from the bundled manifest or an Ed25519-signed compatibility registry. Structural similarity and a successful syntax check are diagnostic evidence; they do not authenticate an unknown file as stock vendor code.

Router upgrades reconstruct the expected existing adapter from a trusted original. A marker string alone is insufficient. Doctor verifies the live adapter against that reconstruction and reports stock-backup health separately.

The selected model can request only the outer tools Grok supplies for that turn. Grok still applies its permissions and performs those actions. A screenshot or sub-agent bridge in the source is not proof that every provider has passed those workflows. Codex Sol and OpenRouter Claude passed real Shell, Read, Screenshot, and completed-child tests on both supported versions. Other models do not inherit those results. Exact receipts and provider limitations are in [TEST-MATRIX.md](docs/TEST-MATRIX.md).

Provider credentials stay out of repository files, Bot state, and diagnostic logs. Routed conversation content is sent to the provider you choose. Read [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) and [HOW-IT-WORKS.md](docs/HOW-IT-WORKS.md) for the data boundary.

## Development and releases

```bash
npm ci --prefix runtime --ignore-scripts --no-audit --no-fund
npm test
npm run build:macos
```

Windows developers can use `npm run build:windows -- x64` or `npm run build:windows -- arm64`. Native Windows CI builds ZIP and Setup artifacts; source-preview status remains until native acceptance is recorded.

A release requires passing tests/builds and the complete [fresh-Bot procedure](docs/FRESH-BOT-ACCEPTANCE.md) on the exact candidate. The tag workflow reruns CI and checks the versioned, source-bound [acceptance record](docs/release-acceptance.json). It refuses a pending or stale record. The README's install command advances only after the new immutable tag is downloadable, preventing another missing-tag 404.

GrokRouter contains its own adapter and provider runtime. It does not distribute Grok Bot's proprietary host source or replace the official desktop app.
